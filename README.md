# TheWorkout
This is my personal workout generator — designed to keep me focused, consistent, and ready to crush my sessions every time!

## What’s Included
This workout is structured into three sections:
1. **Treadmill Running (30 mins)**  
   - 5 mins at an all-out pace  
   - 1 min rest & recovery  
   - Repeat until 30 mins is complete

2. **Rower Circuit (20 mins)**  
   - 200 meters on the rower (175–220 watts)  
   - 20 kettlebell swings  
   - 10 mountain climbers  
   - Repeat for 20 mins. Rest as needed.

3. **Lifting/Floor Workout (20 mins)** 
   - Rotate through:
     - 3 sets of chest press (10–15 reps)
     - 3 sets of chest fly (10–15 reps)
     - 3 sets of walking lunges (10 steps back and forth, 20 total)
     - 3 sets of conventional deadlifts (10 reps)
   - Rest for 30 sec to 1 min after each full rotation. Do not complete all sets at once.

A Reminder: 
Improve your cardio. I only crave pain and runner's high; so should you. Don't waste your time buying dopamine. #quitsmoking #smokefree #weedless
